  I’ve been a huge fan of the membership business model because it creates a dependable income stream.
  I like this for the obvious reason – your cash flow is more consistent – 
  but also because the reliable income lets you invest serious time and energy in your customers,
  because you are well rewarded on an ongoing basis for doing so.<br>
  The key values of IEEE membership are technical innovation, access to cutting-edge information, networking opportunities,
  and exclusive member benefits.
  IEEE memberships support IEEE's mission to advance technology for humanity and the profession.
  At the same time, 
  memberships build a platform to introduce technology careers to students around the world.
  </p>
  <p>our basic goal remains one of providing an interesting and professionally<br>
    exciting set of technical activities for our members so that we can help in promoting their<br>
    professional growth. We will continue to hold as many good quality technical meetings as<br>
    possible to achieve this goal and would like them to be held in a distributed manner in the<br>
    geographical section represented by us, i.e. the U.P. Region. In the U.P. Region, wherever we<br>
    have a sufficient concentration of members or where we feel that IEEE membership can be<br>
    promoted, we have been organizing and would like to continue to organize technical activities (or<br>
    help in organizing them). This has helped and will help further in our goal of promoting IEEE<br>
    membership within the engineering professionals and students in this area. Special initiatives<br>
    planned for the year 2002:<br>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In order to achieve the above, we plan to do the following -<br>
    1. We will continue to promote other regular technical activities in the U.P. Region by providing joint
    sponsorship, support and publicity to conference and symposia organized in and around this region. We
    continue to encourage our members to promote such activities and assist them in organizing these as far as
    possible. We intend to use our communication channels (email, WWW web page, newsletter etc.) to
    publicize these activities so that our members can gain maximum advantage from them. We also generally
    request the organizers of these activities to charge a reduced registration fee for IEEE members so that we
    can then use this to promote the benefits of IEEE membership.<br>
    2. We plan to encourage student membership by organizing activities focused on students'
    needs. We plan to organize useful panel discussions as has been done in the past. We also plan<br>
    to organize site visits to local industrial organizations, power stations and laboratories for them.
    We are considering starting some lectures and group discussions, which can help in providing
    career guidance and counseling to students.<br>
    4. We wish to promote better industry academia ties in our region and the first two special<br>
  initiatives are planned accordingly.</p>

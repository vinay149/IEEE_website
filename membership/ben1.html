<h2>Benefits Of Membership</h2>
<h4>Benefits and Status of IEEE Life Membership</h4>
<p1>
Dues and regional assessments are waived for a Life Member. 
For qualifying Life Members, society fees are waived (IEEE Bylaw I-108.8).
Individuals may receive reduced member rates at conferences where IEEE is the sole sponsor.
IEEE Policy 10.1.15  "Reduced fees, waiver of fees, or fee differential for unemployed IEEE members, retired members, 
and for special registrants (e.g., guests, speakers, and exhibitors) are permitted at the discretion of the Conference 
Organizing Committee.
The individual registration fee for Life Members must be no more than that for students."
Life Members continue to receive the same benefits that are available to other IEEE members.

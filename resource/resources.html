    <p><strong>IEEE Student Branch Online Activity report<br />
      <br />
    </strong>The online Student Branch activity reporting is ready to accept reports for the academic year. The online activity reporting and the officer reporting are the only reports due from Student Branches. Please submit your activity report by 1 May or two months after your academic year ends, whichever is more convenient for your Student Branch. Activity reports are due no later than 1 September annually.</p>
    <p>Please log in using your IEEE account to access the form. It allows you to enter e-mail addresses to electronically send copies of the report to your Region and Section and let them know about the great activities your Student Branches have been organizing.</p>
    <p>By completing the activity report, you will be providing IEEE with important information, meeting IEEE policies, and sharing information with your current and future officers. By submitting the online form, you will also qualify for the annual Student Branch rebate program. Student Branches will receive a combined payment of the Student Branch rebate/allotment, which is based on membership statistics as of 31 December. The rebate is US$2 per Student member of the Student Branch, and the allotment is either US$50 (for Branches with 49 or fewer members) or US$100 (for Student Branches with 50 or more members).    </p>
    <p><strong>IEEE Student Branch officer reporting<br />
  </strong>IEEE Student Branches should remember to report new student officers as elections are held. The Student Branch Counselor (faculty) should be reported at least annually. If officers are not reported, the position will be listed as vacant until reporting of an eligible officer is received and confirmed.</p>
  
    <p><strong>Student mobilization report<br />
    </strong>IEEE sends quarterly reports to all Student Branch Counselors, Student Branch Chairs, Section Student Activities Chairs, and Section Student representatives. The latest news, statistics, awards, and competition updates are provided in the reports to help student activities volunteers promote IEEE member benefits and activities on university and college campuses worldwide  </p>

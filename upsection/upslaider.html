	<p>IEEE is the world's largest professional association dedicated to advancing technological innovation 
	and excellence for the benefit of humanity. IEEE and its members inspire 
	a global community through IEEE's highly cited publications, conferences, 
	technology standards, and professional and educational activities.
    IEEE, pronounced "Eye-triple-E," stands for the 
    Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
    The association is chartered under this name and it is the full legal name.

    <p>
An "IEEE Section" is an IEEE entity which caters to the needs of a specified geographical area.IEEE UP SECTION is also one of the specified area which provide ptaleform for student to showcase their talent in technology</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The IEEE Uttar Prdaesh Section was formed on May 11, 1992. Prior to that, this has been a subsection<br>
      under the Delhi Section since December 28, 1970.<br>
      The names of the office bearers of the section for the year 2002 were approved in Annual
      General Body Meetings held on January 12, 2002. A broad range of technical activities were
      organized in the year 2001 by this section. This included technical meetings, workshops,
      conferences and symposia. Appropriate financial support was provided to organize sponsored
      activities and the occasions were utilized to promote IEEE membership amongst the participants.
      We have also been trying to put in special efforts to increase IEEE membership in the States of
      Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal which are more than 1000 km in length and about 400 km in width<br>
      having a population of about 120 million. The results have been encouraging.
    The Section has a IEEE Neural Networks Research Interest Group (R.I.G.) and two chapters -</p>
    <p> (a) Joint Chapter of Power Engineering and Industrial Applications Societies and </p>
    <p>(b) Joint
  Chapter of Signal Processing and Computer Engineering Societies.</p>
    <p> Several technical meetings
      were also organized under these during the year 2001.</p>
